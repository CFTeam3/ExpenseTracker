# ExpenseTracker
Code Fellows Final Java Project

Nicholas Brown, Rocio Martinez, Davey Oswald, Wasim Soomro

Basic Description of the Project:
An expense tracker is an application that tracks expenses while on a trip/vacation in order to ensure a budget is maintained.
While on vacation not everyone has the luxury of an unlimited budget, thus, our wonderful application will track your expenses via user input to maintain financial responsibility for a stress-free time away!
ExpenseTracker will allow users to Login/Logout/Signup as well as create individual expenses for trips that can be categorized with a description added and expense total.
